## Step 1: Select DOM Elements

- Select DOM elements for displaying weather information using appropriate query selectors.

## Step 2: Fetch Weather Data

- Define a function to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API using the `fetch` API.
- Extract relevant data from the API response such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

## Step 3: Review API Data

- Review the structure of the API response to understand the data available for display.

## Step 4: Display City Name

- Display the city name along with its country code using the provided API data.

## Step 5: Format Date and Time

## Step 6: Display Additional Weather Details

- Display additional weather details such as temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure.

## Step 7: Handle City Search

- Implement functionality to allow users to search for weather information of different cities.
- Add event listeners to handle city search input and trigger the weather data fetching function accordingly.

## Step 8: Add Styling (Optional)

- Apply CSS styling to the weather display elements to improve the visual presentation of weather information.

## Step 9: Error Handling (Optional)

- Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors that may occur during the API request or data processing.

## Step 11: Documentation

- Document the codebase, including function descriptions, variable names, and any implementation details, for better readability and maintainability.

## Step 12: Deployment

- Deploy the application to a web hosting platform or server to make it accessible to users over the internet.
